        <p>Today we have such great weather! I've been sitting on the 
            porch with my dog working. When I finish up work, I'm
            looking forward to going on a nice long walk. While the 
            pandemic is certainly difficult, I feel very lucky
            that there are so many parks and walking trails to 
            keep both me and my dog entertained! </p>

        <p>Wow! Week 2 of the STEP internship already! 
          I can't believe how quicky things are moving. I've gotten to know 
          my hosts and podmates a bit better and they all seem very smart 
          and nice. I'm super excited to work with them. </p>

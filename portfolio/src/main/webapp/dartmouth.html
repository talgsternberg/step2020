      <h1>My Professional Life</h1>
      <h2>Dartmouth College</h2>
      <p>I am a rising sophomore at Dartmouth College. Instead of 
          refering to ourselves as sophomores, we call ourselves by our class's
          graduation year, '23s. At Dartmouth, I have yet to declare a major. I've 
          taken many CS courses and a math course, both of which I've enjoyed,
          but I also want to try out economics and earth science, specifically
          oceanography. At school, I am involved in the Women in Computer Science, 
          or WICS club as well as the surf club. I'm hopeful that I'll get to return 
          to campus sometime soon.</p>
        <h2>Google</h2>
        <p>Last summer in 2019 I attended the Google Computer Science Summer
             Institute, CSSI for short, in the Cambridge MA office. We lived
             in MIT dorms and walked to the office every day for a number of weeks.
             This was my first real exposure to any actual programming, although
             I've always had an interest in math. After taking my first CS course
             at Dartmouth, I decided to apply for thge Google STEP internship
             this summer. Sadly, I'm not working in the Sunnyvale office 
             where I was assigned but I'm lucky enough to be participating with a 
             team from the NYC office! I look forward to developing my CS skills 
             and meeting new Googlers!</p>

        <p> Feel free to visit my LinkedIn and connect with me!
            I'll add a GitHub link as soon as I have projects to share.</p>

      <p>Surfing: Despite the fact I live about 45 minutes away from any surfing spots, 
          I still like to surf every weekend. My favorite spots are Nantasket Beach, 
          Rye Rocks, and the Wall. I've surfed along the California Coast
          and in the Dominican Republic! 
      </p>

      <p>Hiking: I like to spend a lot of time outside. Luckily, I go to school 
          in the mountains and I'm able to get out a lot. In the winter, I also like
          to go skiing!

      <p>If you're a surfer too, check out Magic Seaweed! It is a 
          website/app that allows you to access a ton of information
          about different surf spots around the world. The information
          ranges from current surf conditions to local tips and warnings</p>
